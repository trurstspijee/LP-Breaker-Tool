If you already faced the issues that an LP provider website, where you created some Liquidity Pool Tokens, is not reachable anymore, you understand why we created the LP Breaker Tool. The LP Breaker Tool will help you to split the LP Tokens back into itâ€™s underlying pieces of single tokens. For example if you have LP Tokens for BNB / BUSD Pool you will receive the underlying BNB and BUSD Tokens.
